**Parent Epic:** EPIC: Authentication & Security

Implement password security requirements and complexity validation.

**Requirements:**
- Define password complexity requirements (min 12 chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Implement password validation endpoint
- Implement password change endpoint (POST /users/password)
- Require current password verification for password change
- Implement password history (prevent reusing last 5 passwords)
- Set password expiration policy (90 days)
- Implement password reset flow via email
- Generate secure reset tokens (cryptographically random, time-limited)
- Implement email verification for password reset
- Add rate limiting to password reset attempts
- Implement account lockout after failed login attempts (5 attempts = 15 min lockout)
- Create React UI for password change
- Create React UI for password reset

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Passwords validated for complexity requirements
- Password change requires current password
- Cannot reuse previous 5 passwords
- Password reset emails sent securely
- Reset tokens expire after 1 hour
- Account lockout works and resets after time period
- Failed login attempts tracked
- UI prevents weak passwords
- Password strength indicator in UI
- Clear error messages for password violations

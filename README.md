## Getting Started

### PowerShell Deployment Scripts

The KBudget GPT project uses PowerShell scripts for infrastructure deployment and management. For comprehensive documentation on all scripts, prerequisites, parameters, troubleshooting, and best practices, see the **[PowerShell Deployment Guide](docs/POWERSHELL-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)**.

#### Quick Start

**1. Prerequisites**:
```powershell
# Install Azure PowerShell module
Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser

# Login to Azure
Connect-AzAccount
```

**2. Validate Templates** (recommended before deployment):
```powershell
cd infrastructure/arm-templates/main-deployment
.\Validate-Templates.ps1
```

**3. Deploy Infrastructure**:
```powershell
# Deploy all resources to development
.\Deploy-AzureResources.ps1 -Environment dev

# Deploy all resources to staging
.\Deploy-AzureResources.ps1 -Environment staging

# Deploy all resources to production
.\Deploy-AzureResources.ps1 -Environment prod
```

The deployment includes:
- **Virtual Network**: Network isolation with subnets
- **Key Vault**: Secure storage for secrets and keys
- **Storage Account**: Blob storage for application data
- **SQL Database**: Azure SQL Server and Database
- **App Service**: Web application hosting
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Log Analytics, diagnostic settings, and alerts

For detailed instructions, see [Main Deployment README](infrastructure/arm-templates/main-deployment/README.md) or the [PowerShell Deployment Guide](docs/POWERSHELL-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md).

### Individual Resource Deployment

You can also deploy individual resources:

```powershell
# Deploy only Virtual Network and Storage
.\Deploy-AzureResources.ps1 -Environment dev -ResourceTypes @("vnet", "storage")

# Deploy only SQL Database
.\Deploy-AzureResources.ps1 -Environment dev -ResourceTypes @("sql")

# Deploy only monitoring resources
.\Deploy-AzureResources.ps1 -Environment dev -ResourceTypes @("monitoring")
```

### Resource Groups Only

Deploy Azure Resource Groups for dev, staging, and prod environments:

```bash
# Navigate to the resource groups directory
cd infrastructure/arm-templates/resource-groups

# Deploy all environments
./deploy-resource-groups.sh all

# Or deploy individual environments
./deploy-resource-groups.sh dev
./deploy-resource-groups.sh staging
./deploy-resource-groups.sh prod
```

For detailed deployment instructions, see [Resource Groups README](infrastructure/arm-templates/resource-groups/README.md).

### Resource Group Cleanup

Automate cleanup of old or non-production resource groups to manage costs:

```powershell
# Navigate to the resource groups directory
cd infrastructure/arm-templates/resource-groups

# Dry run - see what would be deleted (safe, no deletion)
./Cleanup-ResourceGroups.ps1 -Environment Development -OlderThanDays 30

# Actual deletion (requires confirmation)
./Cleanup-ResourceGroups.ps1 -Environment Development -OlderThanDays 30 -DryRun:$false
```

For detailed cleanup documentation, see [Cleanup README](infrastructure/arm-templates/resource-groups/CLEANUP-README.md).

## Azure Infrastructure

### Architecture Overview

The KBudget GPT application uses the following Azure resources:

| Resource | Purpose | Environments |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Resource Group** | Logical container for resources | dev, staging, prod |
| **Virtual Network** | Network isolation with subnets | All environments |
| **Key Vault** | Secure storage for secrets, keys, certificates | All environments |
| **Storage Account** | Blob storage for application data | All environments |
| **SQL Database** | Application database (Azure SQL) | All environments |
| **App Service** | Web application hosting (.NET 8.0) | All environments |
| **Azure Functions** | Serverless background processing | All environments |

### Security Features

✅ **Secrets Management**: All passwords and keys stored in Key Vault  
✅ **Managed Identities**: App Service and Functions use system-assigned identities  
✅ **Network Security**: VNet isolation with NSGs and service endpoints  
✅ **Encryption**: TLS 1.2 minimum, encrypted storage and database  
✅ **HTTPS Only**: All web endpoints require HTTPS  
✅ **Access Control**: RBAC and Key Vault access policies  
✅ **Azure AD Authentication**: Enterprise-grade OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect authentication (optional)

### Authentication

The application supports **Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication** for enterprise-grade security:

- **Single Sign-On**: Users authenticate with their organizational credentials
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate Administrator and User roles
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Support for MFA through Azure AD
- **Audit Logging**: Complete authentication audit trail

**Quick Start with AAD:**

```powershell
# 1. Register AAD application
cd infrastructure/arm-templates/aad-app-registration
.\Register-AADApp.ps1 -Environment dev

# 2. Deploy App Service with authentication enabled
cd ../app-service
# Update parameters.dev.json with AAD values
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName "kbudget-dev-rg" `
    -TemplateFile "app-service.json" -TemplateParameterFile "parameters.dev.json"
```

- **[Azure AD Authentication Setup Guide](docs/AAD-AUTHENTICATION-SETUP-GUIDE.md)** - Complete configuration guide

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Manage fine-grained access control across Azure resources with automated RBAC assignment and auditing:

- **Role Assignment**: Assign built-in and custom roles to users, groups, and service principals
- **Least Privilege**: Configure service principals with minimal required permissions
- **Audit & Compliance**: Generate audit reports and validate role assignments
- **Multi-Environment**: Separate RBAC configurations for dev, staging, and production

**Quick Start with RBAC:**

```powershell
# Navigate to RBAC directory
cd infrastructure/arm-templates/rbac

# Preview RBAC assignments (WhatIf mode)
.\Assign-RBAC.ps1 -Environment dev -WhatIf

# Assign roles
.\Assign-RBAC.ps1 -Environment dev

# Audit role assignments
.\Audit-RBAC.ps1 -Environment dev -DetailedReport

# Test RBAC compliance
.\Test-RBAC.ps1 -Environment dev -ValidateLeastPrivilege
```

- **Quarterly Reviews**: Comprehensive review of all access across environments
- **Monthly High-Privilege Reviews**: Review Owner/Contributor role assignments
- **Service Principal Reviews**: Validate service principal permissions and secret rotation
- **Compliance**: Supports SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and GDPR requirements

**Quick Start with Access Reviews:**

```powershell
# Navigate to access reviews directory
cd infrastructure/arm-templates/access-reviews

# Run quarterly access review (all environments)
.\Conduct-AccessReview.ps1 -ReviewType Quarterly

# Run production access review
.\Conduct-AccessReview.ps1 -Environment prod -ReviewType Quarterly

# Monthly high-privilege review
.\Conduct-AccessReview.ps1 -ReviewType HighPrivilege

# Service principal review
.\Conduct-AccessReview.ps1 -ReviewType ServicePrincipal
```
